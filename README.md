# anagram-primes

anagram primes is a repo containing the solution to determining if two words are an anagram of one another using prime numbers assigned to the letters of the alphabet. This method is used rather than doing a sort on each word and then another set of iterations to compare the results of the sorts.

Currently there are solutions using C and Go. I'll get around to making more at some point.

[@tidwall](https://www.twitter.com/tidwall) provided great help and insight into benchmarking the C implementation as well as suggestions yielding the use of the `switch` block and a few other things.
